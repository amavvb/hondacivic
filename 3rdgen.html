            <h2>Third Generation (1983-1987)</h2>
            <p>The 3rd generation Civic followed in September '83, with classic, 1980s angular styling. The sporty CRX model – now something of a cult performance car – was exceptionally well engineered for its time, with 160hp on some versions. Combined with impressive fuel economy ratings, it’s no surprise it led to high sales and waiting lists.</p>
            <p>Honda also introduced four-wheel drive (4WD) and a six-speed manual gearbox in 1984. Four-wheel drive was, at the time, the reserve of high-performance cars and off-roaders, making the 4WD Civic a rarity in its sector.</p>
            <p>The 4WD was originally operated by pushing a button, but soon developed into the automatic technology ‘Real Time’, which powers the four wheels only when required – it’s still in use today.</p>
