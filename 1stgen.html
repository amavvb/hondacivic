            <h2>First Generation (1972-1979)</h2>
            <p>The very first Honda Civic launched as a two-door saloon on July 11, 1972. It had the slogan: ‘We’ll get you where you’re going’. The model was launched in Europe in 1975 in two and three-door models. With a 1,169cc four-cylinder, water-cooled engine – and the ability to run on leaded or unleaded fuel (a then relatively new fuel) – the Civic was an instant hit.</p>
            <p>In the same year, Honda introduced its pioneering Compound Vortex Controlled Combustion (CCVC) engine in the US.</p>
            <p>While others took the route of using catalytic converters to scrub away pollutants, Honda’s CVCC didn’t emit them in the first place. Its efficient combustion cycle helped the Civic exceed tough new clean-air regulations without an exhaust catalyser, solving rather than mitigating the problem.</p>
